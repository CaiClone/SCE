# SCE
Showdown Compound Eyes is a greasemonkey script to add functionalities to pokemon showdown.

I attacked a fairy with a bug move, so I got angry and made this.

#Disclaimer
This is a two day project, so don't expect it to be good or even stable.
Some of its bugs are:
* Won't take into account abilities like Levitate or Huge Power
* Won't take into account items like scarf
* Won't take into account (some) type changes, like "reflect type"
* Won't account for anything else than singles past gen 3.
* There is probably a lot of edge cases left.

What SCE shows is just an approximation useful on most cases, but it may be wrong depending on the circumstances.
I probably won't continue developing this, it's supposed to be a very basic script.

#Features:
* Effectiveness(x2,x4,etc...) on moves (calculated against the current active enemy pokemon).
* Who will attack first, blue means first, red second, black depends on EV. (assumes max IV and no items/abilities).
* Base stats on each pokemon, always useful to know what you are fighting against.
* Boosted stats on the tooltip.
* Able to see tooltips of the enemy team by hovering over their miniatures.
